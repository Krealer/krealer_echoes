# Narrative Outline

The story follows **Krealer**, an escaped subject from the clandestine research
facility known as *The Null Factor*.  Trained to suppress emotions and analyse
others, Krealer now wanders a seemingly normal world in search of humanity.

This outline summarises the planned acts:

1. **Escape and Adjustment** – Tutorial area introducing mechanics and basic
   NPC interactions.
2. **The Town of Greyfell** – Players meet Jayson and other characters while
   uncovering hints about The Null Factor.
3. **Unravelling Threads** – Branching quests reveal Krealer's past and the
   organisation's motives.
4. **Confrontation** – Tactical battles escalate against Null Factor agents.
5. **Resolution** – Multiple endings based on player choices and psychological
   approach.

This document will expand as dialogue and scenes are implemented.
